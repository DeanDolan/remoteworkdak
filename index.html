The key to working at home is <span id="par1-2">stay consistent and follow your typical work patterns</span> as if you were at your place of work. Just like any other day you should get up, eat breakfast and get dressed so you <span id="par1-3">dont slip into a habit of laziness</span>. It is important to stop working at the time you would usually stop working. If you finish at a certain time then you should <span id="par1-4">stop at that time even when working at home</span>. Stop checking your emails and just focus on your personal life from that time onward. Make sure when it is time to go asleep, <span id="par1-5">you go asleep at normal time</span>. Just because your working from home <span id="par1-6">does not mean you should stay up later</span>. A steady schedule is <span id="par1-7">key to success</span> to working from home.</p>
